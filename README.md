# The PKOPZ Project
## created by [nicholas coughlin](https://github.com/couns001) for jeera mona
This is an attempt to remember the coding skills of days gone by, and synthesise recent developments in CSS and HTML languages.
The PKOPZ Project will attempt to rely on Cascading Style Sheets and HyperText Markup Language alone.

Wish me luck!
